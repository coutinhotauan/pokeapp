# PokéApp

Initial ideal from Pawann Kumaarr (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeXJqZCiwTQ&t=291s&ab_channel=Codepur">link to reference</a>)

This app simulates a PokéDex (a pokemon dictionary), where you can check all pokémons from 1ª generation.

## What's new?

Since the Pawann's version, my version for this app brings new features where you can search for a specific pokémon, created your account and store your favorite's pokémons.

- Search Page
- Google account's login
- Favorite's 

## What I used to build?

- http (Pawann used to fetch data from the Pokemon's API)
- Firebase (for login and data storage)
- Modular (for page routing)
